## test_geom.h5m: A simple cube geometry with one volume, six surfaces, and two triangles on each surface.

## no_overlap.h5m: A simple cube and Cylinder geometry with two volumes that do no overlap.

## no_overlap_imp.h5m: The same as no_overlap.h5m but imprinted?

## overlap.h5m: A simple Cube and Sphere geometry with two volumes that do overlap

## small_overlap.h5m: A simple Cube and Cylinder geometry with two volumes that overlap over a very small region

## enclosed.h5m: A simple geometry with two concentric Cylinders - one completely enclosed by the larger one

## brick.exo: A 10 x 10 x 10 brick centered on the origin. No additional sidesets.

## brick-sidesets.exo: A 10 x 10 x 10 brick centered on the origin. Each surface has a sideset.
